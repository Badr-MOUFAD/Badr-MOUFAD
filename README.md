I'm Badr MOUFAD and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en)–[CMAP](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/en) working on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for trajectory prediction and traffic simulation.
Before that, I was a research engineer at [Inria Lyon](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-lyon), team [OCKHAM](https://team.inria.fr/ockham/).
There, I developed fast and modular solvers for regularized GLMs.

In parallel, I am an open source enthusiast, I'm a maintainer of
- [``skglm``](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm), a fast and modular scikit-learn replacement for sparse GLMs
- [``Benchopt``](https://github.com/benchopt/benchopt), a collaborative tool to perform reproducible and transparent benchmarks between solvers
- [``celer``](https://github.com/mathurinm/celer), a state-of-the-art solver for Lasso Like problems
- [``skillner``](https://skillner.vercel.app), a rule-based NLP package that automatically extracts skills from text

I have a major in Industrial management engineering and a minor in data science from [EMINES](https://www.emines-ingenieur.org/) – [Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P)](https://www.um6p.ma/en).
