I'm Badr MOUFAD, an engineer with a major in **industrial management engineering** and a minor in **data science**.
I am currently a Research Engineer at **Inria Lyon** within team **DANTE**. There, I study, design, and implement fast and modular solvers for sparse Generalized Linear Models (GLM).

As an open source enthusiast, I am a maintainer of 
- [``skglm``](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm), a fast and modular scikit-learn replacement for sparse GLMs
- [``celer``](https://github.com/mathurinm/celer), a state-of-the-art solver for Lasso Like problems
- [``skillner``](https://skillner.vercel.app), a rule-based NLP package that automatically extracts skills from text

I am also involved in the development of [``Benchopt``](https://github.com/benchopt/benchopt), a collaborative and easy-to-use tool to perform reproducible and transparent benchmarks between solvers.

I am deeply passionate about computational mathematics, extremely fascinated by coding, and I really enjoy solving algorithmic problems.


# Explore my projects

I like to share my thoughts through simple, hands-on, and well-illustrated [blogs](https://badr-moufad.medium.com/). So far, I have written:

- [**Beyond Linear Regression: Leveraging linear regression for feature selection of continuous/categorical variables**](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-linear-regression-467a7fc3bafb), where I describe an approach to select top-K most relevant features that explains a response
- [**Itâ€™s time to structure your data science project**](https://towardsdatascience.com/its-time-to-structure-your-data-science-project-1fa064fbe46), where I propose a structure to organize data science project to improve their scalability and reproducibility
- [**Deriving the inverse transform sampling method from first principles**](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-insight-on-generating-samples-from-a-custom-probability-density-function-d0a06c290c54), where I build from scratch a tool to generate samples from a custom probability density function
