I'm Badr MOUFAD and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en)–[CMAP](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/en) working on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for mobility trajectory generation.
Before that, I was a Research Engineer at [Inria Lyon](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-lyon), team [OCKHAM](https://team.inria.fr/ockham/).
There, I developed fast and modular solvers for regularized GLMs.

In parallel, I am an open source enthusiast, I'm a maintainer of
- [``skglm``](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm), a fast and modular scikit-learn replacement for sparse GLMs
- [``Benchopt``](https://github.com/benchopt/benchopt), a collaborative tool to perform reproducible and transparent benchmarks between solvers
- [``celer``](https://github.com/mathurinm/celer), a state-of-the-art solver for Lasso Like problems
- [``skillner``](https://skillner.vercel.app), a rule-based NLP package that automatically extracts skills from text

I have a major in Industrial management engineering and a minor in data science from [EMINES](https://www.emines-ingenieur.org/) – [Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P)](https://www.um6p.ma/en).


# Explore my writings

I like to share my thoughts through simple, hands-on, and well-illustrated [blogs](https://badr-moufad.medium.com/). So far, I have written:

- [**Leveraging linear regression for feature selection of categorical and continuous variables**](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-linear-regression-467a7fc3bafb), where I describe an approach to select top-K most relevant features that explains a target variable
- [**It’s time to structure your data science project**](https://towardsdatascience.com/its-time-to-structure-your-data-science-project-1fa064fbe46), where I propose a structure to organize data science project to improve their scalability and reproducibility
- [**Deriving the inverse transform sampling method from first principles**](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-insight-on-generating-samples-from-a-custom-probability-density-function-d0a06c290c54), where I build from scratch a tool to generate samples from a custom probability density function
